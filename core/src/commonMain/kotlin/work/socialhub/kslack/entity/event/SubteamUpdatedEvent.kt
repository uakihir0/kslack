/**
 * The subteam_updated event is sent to all connections for a workspace when an existing User Group is updated.
 * This event is triggered for changes to the User Group information (name, description, or handle)
 * as well as the members of the group.
 *
 *
 * Clients can use this to update their local list of groups and group members.
 * The users field is truncated at 500, however the user_count field will still show the actual count.
 *
 *
 * If you are only interested in User Group membership changes, consider using the subteam_members_changed event instead.
 *
 *
 * This event type may also arise when a subteam has been disabled.
